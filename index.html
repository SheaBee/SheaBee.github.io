      <h2 class="center b-border t-space">Locally Made</h2>
      <p class="center">SheaBee Hand Cream is locally made here in Portland, Oregon using only local and organic products.  Every batch is hand made by artisan craftsman that strive to make every batch like the first one.  I came to the idea of creating a hand cream when I realized that I was allergic to every brand that I tried.  The overuse of artificial scents and ingredients lead to my allergic reaction.  I set out to create a product that was derived solely from nature with no parabens or artificial ingredients.  The natural smell of SheaBee comes form the two major ingredients that make up the name SheaBee.</p>
      <h2 class="center b-border t-space">Our Name's Origins</h2>
      <h4 class="center">SheaBee is a name that describes the two main ingredients used in our hand cream.</h4>
      <h4 class="center t-space">Shea</h4>
        <p class="center b-space">The Shea tree produces a small nut that can be crushed and roasted to create a butter substance that has been used for many generations as salves, an aid for arthritis, and for cooking purposes.  Shea butter also has contributed to our hand cream's very unique and natural sent.  We use the highest quality organically certified shea butter for hand creams. </p>

        <h3 class="center t-space200">Local Beeswax</h4>
        <p class="center">This is the picture of one of our hives that we get our Beeswax comes from.  These bees take pollen from the surrounding area and make honey and beeswax.  They are never feed a corn syrup solution, which is attributing to shorter bee lifespans and a weakening of the bee genetics.  These bees are free to pollinate and attribute greatly to our hand cream and garden.  This beehive has over 80,000 bees.</p>
